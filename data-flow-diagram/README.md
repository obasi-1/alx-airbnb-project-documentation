# Data Flow Diagram (DFD): Airbnb Clone Backend System

This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone backend project.

## Objective

The primary objective of this DFD is to visualize how data moves through the backend system. It illustrates the inputs, processes, data stores, and outputs involved in key operations, providing a clear understanding of the system's data transformations and storage.

## Contents

* `data-flow.png`: The main Data Flow Diagram (exported from Draw.io) illustrating the data flows within the system.

## Key Components Visualized

The DFD captures the interactions between:

* **External Entities:** Users (Guest, Host, Admin) and external systems (Payment Gateway) that interact with the backend.
* **Processes:** The functional transformations that data undergoes within the system (e.g., User Management, Property Management, Booking Management, Payment Processing).
* **Data Stores:** The persistent storage locations for system data (e.g., User Data, Property Data, Booking Data, Payment Data, Review Data).
* **Data Flows:** The pathways along which data travels between entities, processes, and data stores.
